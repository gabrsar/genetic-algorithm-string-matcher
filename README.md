# Genetic Algorithm - String Matcher

First try on genetic algorithms! ðŸ¤“

## Running

```python
python main.py
```

## Output

The algorithm will start with a `TARGET` string, a `POPULATION_SIZE` and a `MUTATION_RATE`. It will generate a initial random population with these parameters and will enter on a while loop that only ends when at least one of the individuals in the population becomes the `TARGET` string.

The console will give feedback of the current generation as well as the current best match and fitness.
